# Go Sample Code

This is the kind of project I make with any new language I'm learning.  As I come across different aspects of the language that I don't understand completely, I try to flesh them out with basic examples and variations.

# Other

Code should generally pass the following, unless deliberately breaking them:

* go tool vet .
* golint .
* go fmt *.go
